Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy an Nginx web server with high availability and basic health checks

Output: k8s/nginx-ha.yaml

Description: This Kubernetes YAML file deploys a set of Nginx replicas with three replicas, a service for accessing the replicas using the clusterIP, and a liveness probe to check the health of the application.

```yaml

kind: Service

  name: nginx-ha-service

    app: nginx-ha

```

This file sets up a Deployment with three replicas of an Nginx container, which use a basic liveness probe and readiness probe to determine if the application is healthy. A Service is also created to expose the replicas to the cluster, using the clusterIP and also a nodePort for external access (30080).
