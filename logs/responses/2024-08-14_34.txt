Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a containerized application with specific environment variables. The deployment configuration specifies a single container using an image built from a Dockerfile and sets various environment variables.

Deployment Configuration:

- Name: my-app-deployment
- Replica count: 3
- Image: my-app:latest
- Port: 8080
- Environment variables:

  1. MY_API_KEY=abc123
  2. MY_SECRET_TOKEN=xyz789

- Service type: ClusterIP
- Service name: my-app-service
- Service port: 80
- Target port: 8080

To create the YAML configuration file for a Kubernetes deployment with the provided intent, you can use the following template as a starting point:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: MY_API_KEY
          value: abc123
        - name: MY_SECRET_TOKEN
          value: xyz789
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

Save the configuration to a file named `my-app-deployment.yaml`.

To deploy the application using this configuration, run:

```
kubectl apply -f my-app-deployment.yaml
```

This command will create a deployments and services for the specified application.
