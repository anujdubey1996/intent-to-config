Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Create a Kubernetes Deployment configuration for deploying a front-end application with dynamic image tags based on Git branch and commit, and with readiness, liveness, and startup probes configured.

Deployment name: myapp-deployment

Container image: my-frontend:latest, using GitHub actions to automatically build and tag Docker images based on the current branch and commit.

Container port: 8080

Number of replicas: 3

Label selector: app=myapp

Readiness probe: HTTP GET /healthz (path: /healthz) with initial delay of 15 seconds, timeout of 5 seconds, and failure threshold of 3.

Liveness probe: HTTP GET /live (path: /live) with initial delay of 15 seconds, timeout of 5 seconds, and failure threshold of 3.

Startup probe: HTTP GET /ready (path: /ready) with initial delay of 10 seconds, timeout of 5 seconds, and failure threshold of 5.
