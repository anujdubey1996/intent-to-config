In this configuration, we create a Deployment with the name "backend-restapp-deployment" and the label "app: backend-restapp" for easy identification. The Deployment is set to have 3 replicas.

The container for the backend-restapp image is specified with your chosen image registry, in this case, "your-image-registry/backend-restapp." The container is set to listen on port 8080 using the TCP protocol.

For resource management, the Deployment defines memory limits of 128Mi and requests of 64Mi. CPU usage is limited to 500m with a request of 500m.

Lastly, an imagePullSecret named "your-image-registry-secret" is specified, which should be used to authenticate and pull the image from the registry. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual data.
