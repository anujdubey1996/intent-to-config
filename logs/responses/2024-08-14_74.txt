Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy Redis Session Store

The Redis session store deployment will have the following characteristics:
- use the name `redis-session-store` for the deployment
- specify the docker image as `redis:6.0`
- use the `8000` port for Redis
- allow the deployment to be configured to use a stable Redis password
- create a persistent volume with a 5Gi size for Redis data storage
- use `redis-session-store` as the name for the volume claim
- use `session-store-pv` as the name for the persistent volume
- use `session-store-pvc` as the name for the persistent volume claim

The resulting deployment YAML file is as follows:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: session-store-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:

              key: password

          claimName: session-store-pvc

    status: "True"
    message: Deployment is ready
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: session-store-password
type: Opaque
data:
  password: YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```

Note that the Redis password is obfuscated with Base64 encoding for security purposes. The actual password value should be obtained securely and should not be hardcoded in this file. This YAML file also assumes that an NFS server with the specified path and server name is running to store the persistent volume data. You may adjust this configuration to suit your needs and environment.
