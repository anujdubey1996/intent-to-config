Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy the "k6loadgenerator" application to run performance tests using a single replica
Pod with 1 CPU, 1Gi Memory, and an environment variable for the number of tests to run.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: k6loadgenerator
  labels:
    app: k6loadgenerator
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:

          value: "200" # The number of virtual users for the performance test
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "1Gi"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8001 # k6 server port

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: k6loadgenerator-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: k6loadgenerator
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8001
      targetPort: 8001
```

This YAML configuration deploys a Kubernetes Deployment named "k6loadgenerator" running a single replica with 1 CPU and 1Gi of memory. The Deployment mounts an environment variable "VU" with a default value of "200" for the number of virtual users in the performance test.

A ClusterIP Service is also created to expose the deployed Deployment. The service port is shared with the container port (8001) specified in the Deployment container.
