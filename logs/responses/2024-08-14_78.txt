Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a pedido-ms service with specified resource requests and limits, and set up liveness and readiness probes to ensure the application's health and availability

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pedido-ms
  labels:
    app: pedido-ms
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pedido-ms
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pedido-ms
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pedido-ms
        image: pedido-ms:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 50Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 100Mi
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 10
```

This Kubernetes Deployment configuration aims to create a service named `pedido-ms` with 3 replicas. It pulls the image `pedido-ms:latest`, exposes the container port `8080`, and sets the specified CPU and memory requests and limits. The liveness probe checks the health of the application periodically at the `/healthz` path while readiness probes ensure the application is able to handle traffic at the same path. The initial delay seconds are set to 15 seconds for both probes.
