Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Create a Kubernetes Deployment for a server application. This deployment manages three replicas of the server container, sets environment variables for connecting to Redis and PostgreSQL databases, and exposes port 5000.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: server-deployment
  labels:
    app: server
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: myregistry/server:latest
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: db-secrets
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 5000
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 5000
```

In this YAML manifest, we deploy a Kubernetes Deployment, with the name `server-deployment` and a label `app: server`. The Deployment manages three replicas of the server container with image `myregistry/server:latest`.

```
replicas: 3
```

The Deployment selects replicas with the label `app: server` and, within the template, it labels each container with the same label:

```
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: server
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: server
```

The container has the name `server`, and it pulls the image from the specified registry:

```
containers:
- name: server
  image: myregistry/server:latest
```

To connect to Redis and PostgreSQL databases, the container receives environment variables from a secret called `db-secrets`. The secret should contain the connection configuration and credentials:

```
envFrom:
- secretRef:
    name: db-secrets
```

The Deployment exposes the server container's port 5000:

```
ports:
- containerPort: 5000
```

Checks for a healthy server status and readiness are set up using HTTP GET requests to `/healthz` on port 5000:

```
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 5000

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 5000
```

Make sure you have appropriate permissions to create secrets and deployments in your Kubernetes cluster, and store your database credentials securely in Kubernetes secrets.

Here's a sample secret to store the database credentials:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  REDIS_HOST: eW91cl9pbnNfY3J5cHQ=
  REDIS_PASSWORD: SSdlIGxvY2FsIE5vcmcvTGF5c3VjIiwidXNlcmNvbm5zaA==
  POSTGRES_HOST: eW91c2VfcGxheXM=
  POSTGRES_USER: dGVzdHVzZXJfdG9rZW4=
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: bGFzc3dvcmQ=
  POSTGRES_DATABASE: bGlicmFyeXNfZGV2LmNvbS50YWJjZA==
```
