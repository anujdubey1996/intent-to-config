Create a Kubernetes deployment workload for a Java microservice running on port 8080.

To create a Kubernetes deployment for a Java microservice running on port 8080, you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to create a deployment, service, and possibly a container image. Here's an example using an arbitrary Java microservice called `my-java-service`.

1. First, create a Dockerfile for your Java service that extends an appropriate base image (e.g., openjdk:11 or tomcat:8.5) and install any necessary dependencies. For this example, I'm assuming a base image with OpenJDK 11 and no additional dependencies.

```Dockerfile
# my-java-service Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11

ARG APP_NAME=my-java-service

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN chmod +x ./${APP_NAME}

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./${APP_NAME}" ]
```

2. Build the Docker image and push it to a container registry such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.

```bash
# Assuming the Dockerfile and your Java microservice source code are present in the current directory
docker build -t my-java-service .
docker push my-docker-username/my-java-service
```

3. Create a `kubernetes/` folder with two YAML files: `my-java-deployment.yaml` and `my-java-service.yaml`.

`my-java-deployment.yaml` (Deployment configuration):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-java-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-java-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-java-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-java-container
        image: my-docker-username/my-java-service
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

`my-java-service.yaml` (Service configuration):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-java-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-java-service
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

4. Apply the configurations:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/my-java-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/my-java-service.yaml
```

This will create a deployment with 3 replicas of your Java microservice and an exposure as a LoadBalancer service. In a few minutes, your service should be available and accessible on the provided load balancer IP address.

You can check the status of the deployment, service, and pods using `kubectl` commands like `kubectl get deployments`, `kubectl get services`, and `kubectl get pods`.
