Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Configure a Kubernetes Deployment for a Zookeeper Operator. The deployment runs a single replica of the zookeeper-operator container, which is used to manage Zookeeper clusters.

Here is a simplified example of a YAML file that can be used as a starting point:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: zookeeper-operator
  labels:
    app: zookeeper-operator
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: zookeeper-operator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: zookeeper-operator
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: zookeeper-operator
        image: zookeeper-operator:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 2181
        - containerPort: 2888
        - containerPort: 3888
```

Replace the image name with the actual image you are using for your zookeeper operator. Make sure you have created a corresponding `Service` or `Ingress` to access the exposed ports.
