Deploy a single instance of the flixpredix-admin service to manage the administration of the FlixPredix application. The deployment runs the latest version of the service from a container image hosted in a regional Docker registry, exposing it on port 8080.

To deploy the flixpredix-admin service on a GCP VM using Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Set up a GCP service account and install the gcloud SDK and Terraform.

   Follow the [official Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#keyfile-json) to create a service account with the necessary roles for deploying Terraform.

2. Install Terraform:

   ```bash
   wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.7/terraform_1.3.7_linux_amd64.zip
   unzip terraform_1.3.7_linux_amd64.zip
   sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
   ```

3. Add the service account credentials to your environment variables:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_credentials.json>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_credentials.json>` with the path to the JSON service account key file downloaded earlier.

4. Set the project ID and region for the deployment:

   ```bash
   export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
   export REGION=us-central1
   ```

   Replace `<your_project_id>` with the ID of your GCP project.

5. Write a Terraform configuration for the deployment:

   Create a file named `main.tf` with the following content:

   ```hcl
   provider "google" {
     version = "~> 4.0"
     project = var.project_id
     region  = var.region
   }

   locator "flxpredix-admin-locator" {
     name = "flxpredix-admin-locator"
     depends_on = [google_service_account.default, google_project.default]
     project_id = var.project_id
   }

   data "dockerregistry_image" "flixpredix_admin" {
     name = "gcr.io/<docker_registry>/flixpredix-admin:v1"
     depends_on = [locator.flxpredix-admin-locator]
   }

   resource "google_container_cluster" "flixpredix-admin-cluster" {
     name     = "flixpredix-admin-cluster"
     location = var.region

     node_config {
       machine_type = "e2-medium"
       disk_size_gb = 100
     }

     cluster_autoscaler {
       enabled = true
       min_node_count = 1
     }

     addons_config {
       horizontal_pod_autoscaling = {
         disabled = false
       }
     }
   }

   resource "kubernetes_deployment" "flixpredix-admin" {
     metadata {
       name = "flixpredix-admin"
       labels = {
         app = "flixpredix-admin"
       }
     }

     spec {
       replicas = 1
       selector {
         match_labels = {
           app = "flixpredix-admin"
         }
       }

       template {
         metadata {
           labels = {
             app = "flixpredix-admin"
           }
         }

         spec {
           container {
             image = data.dockerregistry_image.flixpredix_admin.image
             name  = "flixpredix-admin"
             port {
               name = "http"
               container_port = 8080
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `<docker_registry>` with the name of the Docker registry region where the container image for the flixpredix-admin service is hosted.

6. Initialize the Terraform working directory:

   ```bash
   terraform init -upgrade
   ```

   This command initializes and upgrades the Terraform modules used in the configuration.

7. Plan the deployment:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   This command shows the resources that will be created, updated, or destroyed during the deployment.

8. Apply the Terraform plan:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   This command creates the resources defined in the Terraform configuration, including a GCP project, container cluster, and Kubernetes deployment for the flixpredix-admin service.

9. Verify the deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system
   kubectl get services -n kube-system
   kubectl get deployment flixpredix-admin -n <namespace>
   kubectl get service flixpredix-admin -n <namespace>
   ```

   Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where the flixpredix-admin deployment was created. By default, it is set as the project ID. You can check the namespace using:

   ```bash
   kubectl config view | grep namespace
   ```

   The command should show the flixpredix-admin deployment and service, and provide information about their status and IP address.

10. Access the flixpredix-admin service:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/flixpredix-admin -n <namespace> 8080:8080
   ```

   Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where the flixpredix-admin deployment was created. You should now be able to access the FlixPredix admin UI by visiting `http://localhost:8080` from your local machine.

You have successfully deployed a single instance of the flixpredix-admin service on a GCP VM using Terraform.
