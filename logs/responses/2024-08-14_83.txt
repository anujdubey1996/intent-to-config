Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Create a Kubernetes Deployment for a Consul service, deploying a single replica with specific annotations, port configurations, and resource limits.

Here is your generated Kubernetes deployment configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: consul-deployment
  labels:
    app: consul
  annotations:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
    helm.sh/chart: consul-0.1.0
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: consul
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: consul
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: consul
        image: hashicorp/consul:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8500
          name: consul-http
        - containerPort: 8600
          name: consul-rrp
        - containerPort: 8080
          name: consul-ui
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /v1/health/service/consul
            port: 8500
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /v1/health/service/consul
            port: 8500
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
status: {}
```

This YAML file creates a Kubernetes Deployment called `consul-deployment`. The deployment has one replica running a single container based on the official Consul image from Hashicorp. The container exposes three ports for Consul's HTTP, RRAP, and UI services, respectively. It includes readiness and liveness probes to check the health of the Consul instance. Additionally, it sets resource limits for memory (128 Mi) and CPU (500 m) while requesting 64 Mi of memory and 250 m of CPU.
