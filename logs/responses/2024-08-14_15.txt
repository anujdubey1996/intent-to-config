Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a single instance of the selenoid-chrome-vnc service to enable remote access to a Chrome browser via VNC. The deployment connects to a specified Selenium hub and is configured with resource limits for efficient operation. The service is exposed on port 5900 for VNC connections

For this task, we will need a few things prepared:

1. Dockerfile (if you are using a custom base image you can build yourself) or the built image available in a container registry (Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, etc.)
2. Helm chart for the Selenoid service, if one doesn't already exist

Assuming we have a Dockerfile and a Helm chart for the Selenoid service, here's an example of a Kubernetes deployment configuration file `selenoid-chrome-vnc.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: selenoid-chrome-vnc
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: selenoid-chrome-vnc
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: selenoid-chrome-vnc
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: selenoid-chrome-vnc
          image: <your-container-registry>/selenoid-chrome-vnc:<tag>
          env:
          - name: SELENIUM_HUB_URL
            value: <selenium-hub-url>
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "2"
            requests:
              memory: "256Mi"
              cpu: "1"
          ports:
          - containerPort: 4444 # Remote WebDriver port
            name: rwd
          - containerPort: 5900
            name: vnc
          readinessProbe:
            tcpSocket:
              port: 4444
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: "/"
              port: 4444
```

Customize `<your-container-registry>/selenoid-chrome-vnc:<tag>` with the appropriate container registry and tag for your built or prebuilt Docker image. Also, replace `<selenium-hub-url>` with the URL of your Selenium hub.

Save the configuration file as `selenoid-chrome-vnc.yaml` and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster using kubectl.

```sh
kubectl apply -f selenoid-chrome-vnc.yaml
```

When the deployment is successful, you should see output similar to the following:

```sh
deployment.apps/selenoid-chrome-vnc created
```

Then use the following command to check the status of your deployment:

```sh
kubectl get deployments selenoid-chrome-vnc
```

You should see the `Ready` status increasing as each container in the replica set successfully loads and starts running your Selenoid Chrome VNC application.

```sh
NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
selenoid-chrome-vnc    1/1     1            1           3m11s
```

This demonstrates how to create a Kubernetes Deployment to manage and deploy a single instance of the Selenoid Chrome VNC service on a cluster. Proper configuration, connection to the Selenium hub, resource limits, and health checks have been implemented.
