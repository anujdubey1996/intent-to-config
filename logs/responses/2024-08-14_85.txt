Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a single instance of the Consul service using Kubernetes with the required annotations, labels, and container configurations

Here's an example configuration file for deploying a single instance of the Consul service using Kubernetes, with the specified annotations, labels, and container configurations.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: consul
  labels:
    app: consul
    environment: production
  annotations:
    description: "Consul service deployment for the production environment"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: consul
      environment: production
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: consul
        environment: production
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: consul
          image: bitnami/consul:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8500
              name: consul
            - containerPort: 8600
              name: consul-ui
              protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:
            - name: consul-config
              mountPath: /etc/consul.d
          env:
            - name: CONSUL_DEBUG_HTTP
              value: "true"
            - name: CONSUL_LAN_ADDR
              value: "0.0.0.0"
            - name: CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR
              value: "0.0.0.0"
            - name: CONSUL_HTTP_PORT_HTTP_TCP_8500_PORT
              value: "8500"
            - name: CONSUL_HTTP_PORT_HTTP_TCP_8600_PORT
              value: "8600"
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /v1/health/self
              port: 8500
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /v1/health/self
              port: 8500
      volumes:
        - name: consul-config
          configMap:
            name: consul-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: consul
  labels:
    app: consul
    environment: production
spec:
  selector:
    app: consul
    environment: production
  ports:
    - name: consul
      port: 8500
      targetPort: 8500
    - name: consul-ui
      port: 8600
      targetPort: 8600
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Save this configuration as `consul-deployment.yaml` and then apply it using `kubectl apply -f consul-deployment.yaml` command to deploy the Consul service on your Kubernetes cluster.

This example configuration includes a Deployment workload that creates a single instance of the Consul service, specifies the required annotations and labels, uses the latest version of the `bitnami/consul` Docker image, sets the desired container ports, mounts a ConfigMap for storage of configuration files, and configures environment variables, volumes, readiness probe, and liveness probe. Additionally, it contains a Service workload that creates an external load balancer for the Consul service exposing the required ports.
