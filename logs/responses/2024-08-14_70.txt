Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy Grafana 8.5.5 in the monitoring namespace with a single replica

Create a `grafana-deployment.yaml` configuration file as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: grafana
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: grafana
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: grafana
        image: grafana/grafana:v8.5.5
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
          name: http
        env:
        - name: GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER
          value: admin
        - name: GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL
          value: "/"
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /login
            port: 3000
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /login
            port: 3000
```

The provided configuration will create a Deployment for Grafana 8.5.5, in the `monitoring` namespace with a single replica and the required environment variables for authentication. Additionally, it includes a readiness and liveness probes to ensure that the Grafana pod is ready to accept traffic and is running healthy, respectively.
