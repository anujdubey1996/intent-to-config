Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a worker application, specifying the Docker image and environment variables for Redis connectivity.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: worker-deployment
  labels:
    app: worker
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: worker
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: worker
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: your-docker-image-url:tag
        env:
        - name: REDIS_HOST
          value: redis-service
        - name: REDIS_PORT
          value: "6379"
```

Here's an explanation of the YAML file:

1. `apiVersion`: The API version of the Kubernetes resource being created. In this case, we're using apps/v1 for the `Deployment` resource.

2. `kind`: The type of resource being created. In this case, a `Deployment`.

3. `metadata`: Contains information that helps you identify the object, like its name, namespace, labels, etc.

4. `name`: The unique name given to the deployment.

5. `labels`: Key-value pairs that can be used to label objects with identifying metadata. Here, we're setting `app: worker` as the label for the Deployment.

6. `spec`: Contains the specification of the desired behavior for the `Deployment`.

7. `selector`: The label selector to identify which objects this Deployment controller should manage. In this case, we're setting it to select objects that have the label `app: worker`.

8. `replicas`: The number of replica sets that should be created to make up this deployment. In this case, we're setting it to 3.

9. `template`: Describes the Pod template that the deployment will use when creating or replacing Pods. Contains details about the containers running within the pod, as well as other spec details about the entire pod, like labels, annotations, etc.

10. `containers`: A container specifies a single container to run in a pod. In this case, we're defining one container named `worker`.

11. `image`: The Docker image that should be used to create the container. In this case, `your-docker-image-url:tag` should be replaced with your actual Docker image URL and tag.

12. `env`: Environment variables that will be passed to the container. Here, we're setting environment variables for Redis connectivity. `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` should be replaced with your Redis service host and port.

This YAML file can be saved as `worker-deployment.yaml` and applied using `kubectl apply -f worker-deployment.yaml` to create the worker Deployment in your Kubernetes cluster.
