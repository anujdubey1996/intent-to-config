Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Configure and deploy site-deployment with zero replicas, specifying container details and exposing a port.

Configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: site-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 0
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: site
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: site
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: site-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This YAML file provides a Kubernetes Deployment configuration for a workload called `site-deployment`. It is configured with zero replicas (`spec.replicas: 0`), meaning that no instances of this application will be running at the moment of deployment.

The Deployment uses a Selector (`spec.selector`) to label these replicas, with the selector matching replicas based on the label `app: site` (`spec.selector.matchLabels: {app: site}`).

The `template` field defines the settings for creating the replicas. The `template.metadata` field includes a label for the new replicas, also `app: site` (`template.metadata.labels: {app: site}`).

The `template.spec` part holds the specifications for the container, including its name, image, and ports. The container is called `site-container` (`template.spec.containers[0].name`), uses the latest version of the Nginx image (`template.spec.containers[0].image: nginx:latest`), and exposes a port, specifically port 80 (`template.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort: 80`).
