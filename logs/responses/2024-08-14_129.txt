Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a Kubernetes named details-v1 for managing the details application, specifically version v1.

The details application has a single container named `details` that uses the official Docker image `library/details:v1`. The container should scale to 3 replicas, expose the application on port 8080, and set an environment variable `APP_NAME` to the value details-v1. Also, define a service of type `ClusterIP` with a label `app` of `details-v1` and use the service's `NodePort` to allow traffic to the pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: details-v1
  labels:
    app: details-v1
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: details-v1
  template:

        env:

          value: details-v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
