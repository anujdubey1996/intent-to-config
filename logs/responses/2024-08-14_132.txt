Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Configure a Kubernetes deployment named redisbank-deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redisbank-deployment
  labels:
    app: redisbank
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redisbank
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redisbank
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: redisbank
          image: redis:6.2.7
          ports:
            - containerPort: 6379
          env:
            - name: ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD
              value: "yes"
```

This YAML configuration file represents a Kubernetes deployment with the name `redisbank-deployment`. The `app` label is used as both a metadata label for identifying the deployment as well as a selector. The deployment has 3 replicas of the Redis container, each listening on port 6379, and allowing empty passwords.
