Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Define a Kubernetes deployment for a container running the lalyos/12factor image with environment variables sourced from a secret.

Example configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example
        image: lalyos/12factor
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: example-config
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: regcred
```

This configuration creates a deployment named `example-deployment` with three replicas running the lalyos/12factor image. It sources environment variables from the `example-config` secret in the same namespace as the deployment, and uses an imagesecret named `regcred`. Replace the `name`, `replicas`, `image`, `secretRef.name`, and `imagePullSecrets[0].name` values as appropriate for your needs.
