Now, based on the following intent, generate the corresponding Kubernetes deployment configuration:

Intent: Deploy a single instance of the Delegate-service with rolling update strategy, allowing for controlled updates and rollbacks. The deployment includes a specified image version with always pulling the latest image, sets environment variables, exposes HTTP on port 8080, and defines resource requests to ensure appropriate CPU and memory allocation. The deployment maintains a history of previous revisions for rollback purposes

Configuration:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: delegate-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: delegate-service

    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1

            memory: 256Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 512Mi
          imagePullPolicy: Always

Deployment named 'delegate-service' with 1 replica is being created for the containerized application 'Delegate-service'. The rolling update strategy has been defined, allowing for controlled updates with no downtime and enabling rollbacks if necessary. With the image version set to 'latest', the deployment will always pull the latest image from the specified container image repository. The container is named 'delegate-container', which exposes the HTTP port 8080 for outside access. Environment variables ENV1 and ENV2 have been defined with values 'value1' and 'value2' respectively. CPU request and memory limits have been set to 100m and 256Mi and 200m and 512Mi respectively to ensure appropriate resource allocation.
