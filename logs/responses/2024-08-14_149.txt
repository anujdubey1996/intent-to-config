Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a simple "helloworld" application with two replicas.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helloworld
          image: "gcr.io/gocrunchio/hello:latest"
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
```

This Deployment configuration sets up a Kubernetes workload named helloworld-deployment with two replicas. It consists of a container running the image `gcr.io/gocrunchio/hello:latest` that listens on port 8080 inside the container. The containers and entire Pods created from this Deployment are labeled with `app: helloworld` for easy selection and management.
