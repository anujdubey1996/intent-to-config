Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a single replica of a MySQL database with the image `mysql:5.7`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: super-secret-password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: my-mysql-pvclaim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-mysql-pvclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

This YAML file first defines a Deployment workload for a single replica of the MySQL database using the image `mysql:5.7`. The Deployment also includes environment variable for setting the root password to `super-secret-password`, a container port mapping to 3306, and a volume mount to store the data in the MySQL container.

In the second resource, a PersistentVolumeClaim is defined with the name `my-mysql-pvclaim`, requesting 10 GiB of storage. The persistent volume claim guarantees that the database will have storage for its data, which is mounted to the MySQL container.

You can apply these YAML files to your Kubernetes cluster to create and deploy the MySQL database. You may need to create a persistent volume to back the PersistentVolumeClaim before applying the files.
