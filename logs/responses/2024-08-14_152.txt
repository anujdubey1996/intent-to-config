Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a "pause" container named "inflate" with zero replicas. 

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: inflate
spec:
  replicas: 0
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: inflate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: inflate
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: inflate
        image: k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1
```

This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment named `inflate` with zero replicas. The deployment uses the `pause` container image `k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1`, and both the deployment and container are labeled with the key-value pair `app: inflate`. This labeling allows for simpler management, filtering, and selection of the deployment and its pods based on the app name.
