Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a server application with 3 replicas

Resource: Deployment

File: `server-deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-server-deployment
  labels:
    app: web-server
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-server
        image: your-docker-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Replace `your-docker-image:latest` with the Docker image you want to use for the server application.

Save the configuration file and use `kubectl apply` command to create the deployment.

```
kubectl apply -f server-deployment.yaml
```

To check the status of the deployed deployment, you can use `kubectl get deployments` command.

```
kubectl get deployments web-server-deployment
```
