Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Create a Kubernetes Deployment configuration for a Redis service with a single replica.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-deployment
  labels:
    app: redis
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:6.2.5
        ports:

```

Description:
The provided YAML code defines a Kubernetes Deployment object named `redis-deployment`. The deployment is tasked to manage a single replica of a Redis service. The Redis container uses the Redis version `6.2.5` image and exposes the Redis server running on port `6379`. Both the deployment and the container label the pods with the key-value pair `app:redis`.
