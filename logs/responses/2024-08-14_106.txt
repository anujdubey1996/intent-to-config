Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Create a Kubernetes Deployment configuration for a WordPress application with a Recreate strategy and environmental variables.

The WordPress application consists of the following components:
- Dockerfile to build the application image
- wp-config.php file to store the database settings
- index.php file for the frontend web application

The WordPress application must be exposed as a Kubernetes Service, and it should use a Recreate strategy, which means that if the pod restarts, the old instance will be killed and a new instance of the application will be created. The application should also have access to two environmental variables: `DB_NAME` and `DB_USER`.

Below is a YAML file that describes the requirements for this Kubernetes Deployment. Save this file as `wordpress-deployment.yaml` and apply it using `kubectl apply`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  labels:
    app: wordpress

  replicas: 3
