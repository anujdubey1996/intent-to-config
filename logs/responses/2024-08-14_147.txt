Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a Prometheus Operator webhook with the scheduler set to a custom value

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.upbound.io/v1beta2
kind: WorkloadPrometheusOperator
metadata:
  name: prometheus-operator
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  server:
    service: prometheus
    port: 9090
  webhook:
    scheduler: custom-webhook-scheduler
```

This YAML file defines a Prometheus Operator deployment in the `monitoring` namespace with the following properties:

- The Prometheus Operator server exposes its service on port 9090.
- The Webhook Scheduler runs under the name `custom-webhook-scheduler`. The specific implementation of this scheduler is not provided here and must be implemented separately.
