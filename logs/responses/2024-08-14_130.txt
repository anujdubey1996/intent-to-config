Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy users-deployment to run 3 replicas of the users application.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: users-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: users
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: users
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: users
        image: busybox
        command: ["sleep", "3600"]
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: users-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: users
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```
Here I created a `Deployment` and `Service` object for the users-deployment. The Deployment manages the desired number of replicas (3) for the users application container, which runs on the BusyBox image and sleeps for 1 hour (3600 seconds). In this example, I used the BusyBox image for simplicity, but you should replace it with the appropriate Docker image for your users application.

The Service creates an accessible endpoint for other Kubernetes services or pods to interact with the users-deployment, by exposing traffic to the users-deployment service on port 80. The selector matches the label in the users-deployment pods, and traffic is forwarded to the users application container on port 8080.
