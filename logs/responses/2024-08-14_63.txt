Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Define a Deployment for a helloworld application

Here's the Kubernetes Deployment configuration YAML file for a `helloworld` application:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world-deployment
  labels:
    app: hello-world
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-world
        image: busybox:1.28
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
        command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /dev/null"]
```

This YAML file creates a Kubernetes Deployment workload for a container running the `busybox:1.28` container image named `hello-world`. It setups `3` replicas of the container, defines a rolling update strategy, and mounts port `8080` TCP. By running the `tail -f /dev/null`, the container sits idle and does not perform any action, making it ready to receive requests.

To apply this Deployment, save the above YAML configuration in a file, such as `helloworld-deployment.yaml`, and execute `kubectl apply -f helloworld-deployment.yaml` on your command-line.
