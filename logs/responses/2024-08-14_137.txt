Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Configure a single replica of the `customer` application using the Docker image `chmatvey/customer:latest` and set an environment variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` with the value `kube`

Here's the `customer-deployment.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: customer-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: customer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: customer
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: customer
        image: chmatvey/customer:latest
        env:
        - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
          value: kube
```

You can apply the configuration using the following `kubectl` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f customer-deployment.yaml
```
