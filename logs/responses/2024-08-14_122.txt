Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy Kubernetes application named myapp02-deployment with 2 replicas, using a RollingUpdate strategy

Here's an example of a Kubernetes deployment configuration manifest file based on your intent:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp02-deployment
  labels:
    app: myapp02
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp02
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp02
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp02-container
        image: myapp02:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Save this configuration as `myapp02-deployment.yaml` and deploy it with kubectl:

```bash
kubectl apply -f myapp02-deployment.yaml
```

The command creates a Deployment in your Kubernetes cluster named `myapp02-deployment` with 2 replicas using a RollingUpdate strategy. The strategy ensures that no more than 0 pods are unavailable during updates, and the surging can be at most 1 additional pod. The Deployment uses the label `app: myapp02` to select and manage pods. The Pod template uses the MyApp02 container image with the latest tag, and exposes port 80 for traffic.
