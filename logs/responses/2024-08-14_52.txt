Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Create Kubernetes Deployments for Airbyte components with configurations for resource limits and environment variables.

```

Description: Thisyaml file creates two Kubernetes Deployments for Airbyte components: one for the API service and one for the dbt-core service. Each deployment has a specified number of replicas, a Selector for selecting pods, aTemplate with the Pod template, and a container with the container specifications, including image, ports, resource limits, and environment variables.

The API service's image is airbyte/airbyte-api with a version specified, and it listens on port 80. It has a memory limit of 128 Mi and a CPU request of 200 m. The environment variables AMBASSADOR_HOST and AMBASSADOR_PORT are set to airbyte-api.service.internal and 80, respectively.

The dbt-core service's image is airbyte/airbyte-dbt-core with a version specified, and it runs dbt with the command "dbt run". It has a memory limit of 128 Mi and a CPU request of 200 m. The environment variables DB_URL, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD are set for connecting to the database. Please replace `<version>`, `<image-pull-secret>`, `airbyte-api.service.internal`, `<database-url>`, `<database-user>`, and `<database-password>` with the actual values specific to your setup.
