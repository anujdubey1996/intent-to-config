Create a Kubernetes deployment workload configuration file based on the provided intent.

Intent: Deploy a single instance of the flixpredix-admin service to manage the administration of the FlixPredix application. The deployment runs the latest version of the service from a container image hosted in a regional Docker registry, exposing it on port 8080.

`kubectl create deployment flixpredix-admin --image=us-west-1.docker.example.com/flixpredix/admin:latest --port=8080`

In addition to the command provided above, you may want to create a service for the deployment to make it accessible from other Kubernetes resources. Here's how you can do that:

```
kubectl expose deployment flixpredix-admin --type=ClusterIP --port=8080
```

This command creates a Kubernetes service for the `flixpredix-admin` deployment, exposing it on port 8080. The service type `ClusterIP` makes it accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster. You can get the details of the created service using the command `kubectl get svc flixpredix-admin`.

If you want to expose the service externally (e.g., to the internet), you can use a service of type `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` instead. For example:

```
kubectl expose deployment flixpredix-admin --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

This command creates a Kubernetes service exposed as a load balancer on the internet, which will allocate an external IP to route traffic to the deployment. Similarly, you can use `NodePort` to expose the service on a specific port on each worker node.
