Create a Kubernetes deployment configuration for a Python web application that serves a simple HTTP response.

You may use an already existing project or generate a new one with the following command.

`$ cookiecutter create-project webserver`

And then update the `README.md` file to include the following contents:

I have written a simple web server which serves a JSON response containing three entries:
- name
- version
- port
The endpoint /entrypoints can be hit, it will return a response containing the information.

To test the application is working as intended, use curl to hit the /entrypoints endpoint:
```$ curl localhost:5000/entrypoints
